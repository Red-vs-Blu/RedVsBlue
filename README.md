1. Credits can be withdrawn at any time.
1. There are no fees to deposit or withdraw credits.
1. There are 4096 blocks per round, each round one color wins.
1. Each bet for the winning color claims its share of the losing bets.
1. After a round is over, if you won, you can claim your winnings.

## Why build this

This has been a super fun way to spend some time on the weekends learning solidity and messing with a frontend app. The entire contract is fairly straightforward and does not allow the contract deployer any special privileges. You can review the contract [RedVsBlue.sol](https://github.com/Red-vs-Blu/RedVsBlue/blob/master/contracts/RedVsBlue.sol) to see for yourself.

## Feeling generous

Send things than can be swapped for coffee to the contract's deployer address (`0x6Cb10D1BDe7aAEf8ff7FAFF1DA258373e7964D02`).
